# Type Alias

## type Annotation = Object

```cangjie
public type Annotation = Object
```

Function: An alias for [Object](../../core/core_package_api/core_package_classes.md#class-object).

> **Note:**
>
> This type alias is used to represent the concept of an “annotation instance returned by reflection” and is type-wise equivalent to Object. It is unrelated to the language’s built-in meta-annotation @Annotation. Using @Annotation does not require importing std.reflect.
